  - Ah! Apprentice, We don't have much time! You need to help my assistant in a couple
    of tasks, as I am indisposed at the moment and need some help. Remember that
    demon thing? Yeahhh. First things first, decipher the notes in my potion room
    and look for the symbol infused with magic. Proceed to help my assistant with
    the right recipe to create a magical potion. We will need it later. Hop to it
    as I'm probably going to die soon!
  - "Assistant, we don\u2019t have much time! I need you to develop a potion that
    will help you form magical abilities! My apprentice will help you with the recipe.
    First, look for the magic symbol that my apprentice will tell you, make note
    of its color and then look for a special ingredient around the room! Those two
    things will tell my apprentice the recipe to make the potion! Hurry, I don\u2019t
    have much time and I'm probably going to die soon, remember that demon thing?
    Y-yeah."
  - "You were close, I think\u2026 Remember, the symbol and the special ingredient
    are necessary for the recipe."
  - Hahah! Your foolish archmage will be mine now!
  - Congratulations on deciphering my notes! Please proceed up the stairs.
  - "Wonderful! You should be able to see the entrance to my private lab now. It's
    not just in the open though. And try to keep a hold of your lunch on the way
    down, please, I\u2019d hate to have to clean that up."
  - "That other guy must have taken quite the fall if you made it here first\u2026"
  - "You sure that other guy should be the apprentice? He\u2019s pretty slow walking
    up a single flight of stairs\u2026"
  - Welcome to my laboratory. No time for pleasantries though. I will only say this
    once. The ritual circle is located in the center of a maze. To activate it, you
    must empower each of its sigils. Only then can you save me.
  - "Is this thing working? Okay\u2013so, that was my pet ghost, got him from Luzro,
    yeah\u2013don\u2019t ask questions. Since he doesn\u2019t recognize you, you
    are gonna have to avoid him. Remember, keep going for the levers."
  - "Oookay, so probably should have told you that if he catches you a third time,
    he actually will take your soul to Luzro, and well\u2026 you\u2019ll die. Good
    luck!"
  - "Luzro will be receiving two souls on this eve\u2026"
  - "Yes, YES! I\u2019m free! GOOD JOB LADS! Maybe I'll start paying you or teaching
    you something useful\u2026MAYBE\u2026 maybe."
  - Do you hear it? It's the sound of your demise quickly approaching.
  - Do you think you can outrun the warden of those halls? Make it to the center
    before he gets to you?
  - If you trap your buddy, I'll give you untold riches.
  - Welcome to the maze library. pls guide. thank.
